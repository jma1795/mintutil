# Warthunder's Ultimate Linux Toolbox
This Utility is a compilation of Linux tasks and scripts I use on each Linux system I use. Its eventual scope is meant to streamline installs and be a swiss-army knife for the debian realm. I want to debloat with tweaks, and fix problems and issues with simple scripts updates. I am open to any contributions but let's keep it civil. Also I'm just doing this for fun as I am just learning how to code and write scrips so I will do my best to keep this project clean and efficient. For now the scope is for my LM and LMDE systems but that could change in the future as time allows.
