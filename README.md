# Warthunder's Ultimate Linux Toolbox (aka Mintutil)
This Utility is a compilation of Linux tasks and scripts I use on each Linux system I use. This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, a swiss-army knife for the debian realm so to speak. It's offered as use at your own risk type of thing, without any support. I'm open to controbutions but I'm just doing this for fun as I am just learning how to code and write scrips so I will do my best to keep this project clean and efficient. For now the scope is for my LM and LMDE systems but that could change in the future as time allows. I don't ever plan to match the functionality of Xerolinux's Toolbox but consider that where I got my idea from. If you run arch its a great tool.

**Install / Usage**
You'll just need git and bash to get started

``` 
git clone https://github.com/jma1795/mintutil.git
cd mintutil
bash mintutil
``` 
as a note, some fixes and script will add repositories to imprelemt fixes. These repos are likely not apart of your distrobution and are not their concern.

**Toolkit Notes**
This utility isn't intended for custom Debian-Based distros. While some elements might function, I only test on Linux Mint or LMDE -  I can't ensure seamless compatibility due to differences in each distro. I typically recoment using such Distros like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint or LMDE anyway.

**How to Contribute**
Support requests through github here and we'll add fuctionality where we can. It won't be perfect but if there is something you need your debian tool to use, by all means.
